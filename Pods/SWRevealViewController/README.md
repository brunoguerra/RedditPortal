# SWRevealViewController

A UIViewController subclass for presenting two view controllers inspired on the FaceBook app, done right!

## Features

* Reveal view controller implemented using view controller containment, done right!.
* API is easier than a UINavigationController.
* Correctly handles appearance methods on its child controllers that you can rely on.
* Correctly handles rotations.
* Can be embedded as a child view controller of other controllers, it just works, no glitches, no interface artifacts, no initialization issues, no rotation or resizing problems.
* Seamless integration of pan gesture recognizer, behaving as smooth as silk.
* Includes a category method of UIViewController 'revealViewController' to get the parent SWRevealViewController of any child controller. Similar to the UIViewController's property 'navigationController'.
* Light weight, Clean, Easy to read, self explaining code you will enjoy using in your projects.

## Requirements

* iOS 6.0 or later
* ARC memory management.

## Usage

* Copy the following to your project:
   * SWRevealViewController.h
   * SWRevealViewController.m


* Initialize an instance of a SWRevealViewController passing in a "rear" and a "front" view controllers.
* Use the SWRevealViewController instance in your code as you would use any view controller.
* Deploy as the application window rootViewController, or as a child of other containment controllers.
* Add the panGestureRecognized provided by the SWRevealViewController to a suitable view of your "front" view controller, for example use the viewDidLoad method of your controller to add the gesture recognizer to a navigationBar.
* At any time, you can reveal, conceal the "rear" view or replace the "front" view controller, programmatically or based on user actions, with or without animations enabled

## Basic API description

Initializing a SWRevealViewController:

    - (id)initWithRearViewController:(UIViewController *)rearViewController frontViewController:(UIViewController *)frontViewController;
	
Setting or changing the front view controller:

    - (void)setFrontViewController:(UIViewController *)frontViewController animated:(BOOL)animated;

Setting the position of the front view controller. Position can be FrontViewPositionLeft, FrontViewPositionRight, FrontViewPositionRightMost or FrontViewPositionRightMostRemoved:

	- (void)setFrontViewPosition:(FrontViewPosition)frontViewPosition animated:(BOOL)animated;
	
Obtaining a gesture recognizer to add to your front view controller:

	- (UIPanGestureRecognizer*)panGestureRecognizer;
	
Other methods are documented in the SWRevealViewController.h header file.
